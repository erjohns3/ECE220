The purpose of this program is to be able to take unsolved sudoku puzzles and solve them.  This program works by recursively going through each of the the initally empty places in the puzzle which is designated by a zero and increasing the value until it's valid.  The program checks if a value is valid by checking if there is any duplication within the place's row, column, or subregion.  It does this by taking the place's entire row, column, and subregion one at a time, and copy the values into another array and then sorting them.  If the puzzle indicates that the diagonals have to have unique values also, the diagonals are copyed too.  They are then checked for duplication of values besides 0 because it is easier to check for duplication in a sorted array rather than an unsorted array.  The checker returns if the puzzle is incomplete, illegal, or finished.  Once the checker finds the puzzle to be finished, the program is done and the puzzle is solved.
