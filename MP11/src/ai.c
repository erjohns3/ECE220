/*! AI module

    Implements the Artifical Intelligence of the computer controlled snake by
    providing a function that determines the computer's next move based on the
    current game state.
    
    The AI's goal is simply to find the shortest path to the nearest food, and to
    then follow that path.  If food is inaccessible, then the AI's goal is to avoid
    hitting walls.

void find_food(board * cur_board, int * distance_map, int row, int col,

/*! Given a board (data structure specified in game.h), a starting row and column,
    and a given path distance traveled, recursively search the board to find the
    shortest path to food.  The closest_distance input/output parameter indicates
    the closest distance to food found thus far.  When closer food is found, update
    closest_distance to reflect that.

    The distance map parameter is an array of integers corresponding to the board
    cell array.  In order for the search of large boards to finish in a reasonable
    amount of time, each entry in the distance map should be updated with the shortest
    path distance found to the corresponding cell thus far and a branch of the search
    should be ignored if it finds a path to a cell that is as long or longer than the
    shortest distance recorded in the distance map for that cell. (because that
    search is going to produce the same or worse results)
