The purpose of this project was to format the information in a database into an array print the array in a specific format with hexadecimal without using a trap function.  I went about doing this by going through the database checking the address where the strings started and what the corresponding 3 choices were and storing them in the array.  Once they were all stored in the array I had to print them.  I did this by turning the starting address of each string into sequential record numbers with its corresponding choices printed in hexadecimal.  To be able to print without TRAP, I had to create a replacement subroutine.
