The purpose of this program is to count how many occurences there are in a string of each letter of the alphabet and any nonalphabetic characters.  The program then displays the the number of occurrences represented in 4 digit hexadecimal next to the corresponding character.  I approached the printing part the program by going through each of the characters in the histogram and splitting the 16 digit binary number into 4 sets of 4 bits and converting each set into the ascii value of its corresponding hex code character.  I then printed the ascii characters for the hex values next to its bin character.  I gave each bin character its own line.
