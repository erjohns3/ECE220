The purpose of this program was to implement a connect four game that takes the input two players.  The file containing the functions used by the main file to run the game had bugs in it.  I went through the file searching for typos such as missing paranthesis and semicolons.  I found a couple of the bugs that way.  The rest were logic based bugs.  The playAgain function wasn't setting again to any value so I fixed that.  I found that the checkWin function was checking the board incorrectly so I had to swap the "&&" with "||".  I also had to add in code the check which player made the winning move instaed of just saying player 1 won.  I also had to fix checkMove to make sure the player only inputs a single digit number within 1 and 7 without any spaces or zeroes.
