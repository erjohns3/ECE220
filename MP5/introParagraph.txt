The purpose of this program is to take a single integer seed given by the user to generate 4 random numbers.  The user than has to find out what those random numbers are by inputting their own set of four numbers and see how they compare by being told how many numbers are higher, lower, and equal to the correct numbers.  The user has 10 tries to find the correct numbers.  My role in making the program was to set pointers to equal random numbers based on a seed for easier debugging and make sure the seed was only a single digit number.  I also had to take the users guesses and be able to seperate the users guess string into four numbers and than make sure each number was within 1-8.  I then had to print out how many of the guessed numbers were higher, lower, or equal to the corresponding solution numbers.
