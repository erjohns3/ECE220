The point of this program is to output an image that is a source image modified by a filter chosen by the user. I went about this by writing the code for various functions for the filters.  The getRadius function calculates the radius of the gaussian filter based on the given sigma value.  The calculateGausFilter function creates the filter array used by the convolveImage function.  The convolveImage function applies the gaussian filter to each pixel of the image. The pixelate function divides the image into blocks and applies the average color values to all pixels within the block.
