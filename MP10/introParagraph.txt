The purpose of this MP was to make the first part of a snake game.  I had to open up the file that states how the game is to be setup and allocate enough memory for the game.  I also had to look through the file and set each of the cells to be open, a wall, or a snake segment based on the contents of the file.  I then had to add food to a random open cell every so often based on a given probabilty.  I had to also allocate enough memory for a board and cells and be able to find out the location a cell in memory.  Then I had to create functions that free up the previously allocated space for the snakes, board, cells, and game.
