The purpose of this program is to create a WAV from a file by applying the little endian function to each component of the header and print out information about the WAV that makes more sense for a human than the information directly from the file.  The program then creates another file that contains a looped sample of the input file.  The amount and the start and end of the sample is chosen by the user.  I had to create the little endian functions for 2 and 4 characters, create the read file function, and the sloop function.
