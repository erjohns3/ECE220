The purpose of this project was to format the information in a database into an array print the array in a specific format with hexadecimal without using a trap function then using the array to make a build your own adventure story game.  I went about doing this by going through the database checking the address where the strings started and what the corresponding 3 choices were and storing them in the array.  Once they were all stored in the array I had to print them.  I did this by turning the starting address of each string into sequential record numbers with its corresponding choices printed in hexadecimal.  To be able to print without TRAP, I had to create a replacement subroutine.  For making the functioning game portion of the program, I started at the beginning of the array that I had made previously and printing the text of record 0 and prompting the reader to choose one of the the given choices.  If the reader chooses a choice that isn't given than I tell the reader that it is invalid and repeating the text and prompt the reader again.  If the reader makes a valid choice than I set load the text from the page that corresponds to the readers choice.
