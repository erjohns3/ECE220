In this MP, I made a switch statement that does a certain thing when the key is set to either 0,1,2,or 3.  For key=0, it calls a printBinary function which prints the given value in binary.  For key=1, it prints the value with "%o" which prints the given value in octal.  For key=2, it prints the value with "%d" which prints the given value in decimal.  For key=3, it prints the value with "%x" which prints the given value in hexadecimal.  I made the printBinary function by checking if each bit of the value is 1 or 0 by checking if the MSB and then bit shifting the whole value to the left.  I know that the MSB is 1 if the value is negative.
