NOTE: Tests of the challenges are somewhat independent, but the word
      count that you pick for one line with justification should be the
      same as what you pick without justification (that's why it says
      that the wrapping is required for justification).

      Be sure to turn off path printing, if you did it last week, or
      your outputs will not match.

Explanations of the files in this directory:

undo testing uses chained.obj in case you implemented reachability
  runundo - a test that exercises the undo command
  undoout - results for runundo (with undo challenge implemented);
            note the standard invalid command string when no undo is possible

chained-nf.obj - a fully reachable version of surreal with no linefeeds
              in the text other than to mark paragraphs; for use with
	      testing word-wrapping and justification
  runwrapone - run with wrapping turned off (M[0x800 = 0])
  runwraptwo - run with wrapping at 64 characters
  runwrapthree - run with wrapping at 4 characters
  wraponeout - results for runwrapone (with or without wrapping challenge)
  wraptwoout - results for runwraptwo (with wrapping challenge)
  wrapthreeout - results for runwrapthree (with wrapping challenge)
  justoneout - results for runwrapone (with or without justification challenge)
  justthreeout - results for runwraptwo (with justification challenge)
  justtwoout - results for runwrapthree (with justification challenge)
